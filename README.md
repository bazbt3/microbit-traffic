## What is this?

A program to to simulate a UK traffic light sequence by illuminating red, yellow and green LEDs when a pushbutton is pressed.  Created for the [BBC micro:bit V2 computer](https://microbit.org) interfaced with an Osoyoo sensors & devices STEM kit.

## What is a BBC micro:bit?

An [embedded system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system) computer, with dimensions half the size of a credit card.  Code must be written on a computer or a portable device before 'flashing' the program to the micro:bit via a either USB cable or Bluetooth.

## How was the program created?

It uses the Microsoft MakeCode IDE (blocks of code similar to Scratch.) In this case all the coding has used [the iPhone micro:bit app.](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/micro-bit/id1092687276).  However, [other platforms, apps and languages](https://microbit.org/code/) can be used.

Note: I used only the block editor so be aware that the MicroPython and is not ordered 'neatly'.

## The Osoyoo interface board and sensors

Various breakout boards are available, but I chose the [Osoyoo STEM Kit for micro:bit.](https://osoyoo.com/2019/06/13/osoyoo-steam-kit-for-microbit/)  The kit comprises the board, 20 sensors & devices, cables with connectors, an IR remote, an instruction CD, all packaged up in a sturdy box.
